Vim uses the hjkl keys for basic document navigation instead of the arrow keys. Do you know why?  
Let's start with a little bit of history. When Bill Joy created the original Vi editor in 1976 he used ADM-3A terminal. As you can see the arrow keys are in the position of the hjkl keys. He then used the same keys for navigation.

Just remember, to navigate in the document you need to be in Normal Mode. We have a suggestion for you: in the section [Useful links](/links) you can find a link to Vim Adventures. It'll help you practicing/training your muscular memory.

|--------|------------|

| **k**  | Up key     |
| **l**  | Right key  |

> Quick tip: Try not using the arrow keys and get used to these keys instead. Your life will be better and you'll be more productive.
