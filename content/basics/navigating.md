Let's start with a little history. Why does vim use **hjkl** keys to navigate?  
When Bill Joy created the *Vi* he used the ADM-3A terminal, as you can see the arrows are *hjkl* keys. Then he used the same keys...

Just to remember, to navigate you need to be in *Normal Mode*. We have a suggestion for you, in the section [Useful links](/links)  you'll see a link to **Vim Adventures**. It'll help you to practice/training you muscular memory.

 Key     | Description|
|--------|------------|
| **h**  | Left key   |
| **j**  | Down key   |
| **k**  | Up key     |
| **l**  | Right key  |
