The first thing that you need to know is, why Vim has modes... So when vim was created didn't exist GUI and mouse.
Now let's think how I can write something or navigate in the lines... That's why you need to have modes and you need to know how to use it.
Let's go to understand theses modes.  

------------

- **Normal Mode**: *(as know as Command Mode)*, here is where you can do things like (copy,paste,find,replace) and execute commands like (:w to save,:q to quit). 
- **Visual Mode**: here is where you can select text.   
- **Insert Mode**: here is where you can edit your text.
