Insert Mode is where you can write/edit your documments. From Normal/Command mode, you can use one of the following keys to switch to Insert mode:  

| Key     | Description   																											|
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **i**   | This key switches to insert mode and allows you to edit text right before the current cursor position |
| **I**   | This key switches to insert mode and places the cursor at the beginning of the line  |
| **a**   | This key switches to insert mode and allows you to edit text right after the current cursor position|
| **A**   | This key switches to insert mode and places the cursor at the end of the line|
| **o**   | This key switches to insert mode adding a line below the current one|

> Just remember: if you need to move between words or lines, you need to switch back to **Normal Mode** by pressing the ESC key.  
> To save the file, type the **ESC** key to switch back to **Normal Mode** then type :w. The most important: to quit vim, type **:q** while in **Normal Mode**.
